# Accessibility

\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \]

Introduces accessibility concepts that relate to Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps.

Accessibility is about making your app usable by people who have limitations that prevent or impede the use of conventional user interfaces. For some situations, accessibility requirements are imposed by law. However, it's a good idea to address accessibility issues regardless of legal requirements so that your apps have the largest possible audience. There's also a Windows Store declaration regarding accessibility for your app.

**Note**  Declaring the app as accessible is only relevant to the Windows Store.
