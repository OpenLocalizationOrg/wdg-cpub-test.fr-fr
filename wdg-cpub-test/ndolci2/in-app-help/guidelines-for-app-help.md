# Guidelines for app help


\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \]


These guidelines describe how to design effective Help content for your app. Help content should be a single page and can include text, links, and images. If you need to provide dynamic Help content, link to a support website or embed an online page in your Help section.

It's up to you whether to include Help; not every app needs a designated Help section. For example, if you app contains only one or two UI elements that might confuse a user, you could integrate [instructional UI](instructional-ui.md), create a simple in-app demo, or consider redesigning those elements instead of creating a separate help section. If you do create a designated Help section, it's best to keep it as succinct as possible.

-   Keep Help pages short and easy for users to browse.
-   If your Help content doesn't fit on a single page or if you need to include dynamic content that'll need updating, link to a support website or embed an online page in your Help flyout. Keep in mind that linking to a web page takes your user out of the app experience. If possible, embed the online content to create a more cohesive user experience.
-   Avoid technical terms and jargon.
-   Don't use Help to document all your app features. If you want to provide detailed content about your app, consider providing a link to a support web page at the end of your Help content.
-   Don't use Help to notify customers that a newer version of the app is available.
-   Allow users to access Help from the Settings page.
