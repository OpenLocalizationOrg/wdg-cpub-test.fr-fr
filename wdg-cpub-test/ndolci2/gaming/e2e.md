# Windows 10 game development guide


\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \]

Welcome to the Windows 10 game development guide!

This guide provides an end-to-end collection of the resources and information you'll need to develop a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) game.

## Introduction to game development for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP)


When you create a Windows 10 game, you have the opportunity to reach millions of players worldwide across phone, PC, and Xbox One. With Xbox on Windows, Xbox Live, cross-device multiplayer, an amazing gaming community, and powerful new features like the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and DirectX 12, Windows 10 games thrill players of all ages and genres. The new Universal Windows Platform (UWP) delivers compatibility for your game across Windows 10 devices with a common API for phone, PC, and Xbox One, along with tools and options to tailor your game to each device experience.

This guide provides an end-to-end collection of information and resources that will help you as you develop your game. The sections are organized according to the stages of game development, so you'll know where to look for information when you need it.

To get started, the [Game development resources](#resources) section provides a high-level survey of documentation, programs, and other resources that are helpful when creating a game.

This guide will be updated as additional Windows 10 game development resources and material become available.

## Game development resources


From documentation to developer programs, forums, blogs, and samples, there are many resources available to help you on your game development journey. Here's a roundup of resources to know about as you begin developing your Windows 10 game.

> **Note**   Xbox One development and select Windows 10 gaming features (Xbox Live Services, for example) are managed through programs such as ID@Xbox and Microsoft Studios. This guide covers a broad range of resources, so you may find that some resources are inaccessible depending on the program you are in or your specific development role. Examples are links that resolve to developer.xboxlive.com, forums.xboxlive.com, xdi.xboxlive.com, or the Game Developer Network (GDN). For information about partnering with Microsoft, see [Developer Programs](#programs).

## Concept and planning


In the concept and planning stage, you're deciding what your game is going to be like and the technologies and tools you'll use to bring it to life.

### Overview of game development technologies

When you start developing a game for the UWP you have multiple options available for graphics, input, audio, networking, utilities, and libraries.

If you've already decided on all the technologies you'll be using in your game, great! If not, the [Game technologies for UWP apps](game-development-platform-guide.md) guide is an excellent overview of many of the technologies available, and is highly recommended reading to help you understand the options and how they fit together.

### Choosing your graphics technology and programming language

There are several programming languages and graphics technologies available for use in Windows 10 games. The path you take depends on the type of game youâ€™re developing, the experience and preferences of your development studio, and specific feature requirements of your game. Will you use C#, C++, or JavaScript? DirectX, XAML, or HTML5?

### DirectX

Microsoft DirectX is the choice to make for the highest-performance 2D and 3D graphics and multimedia. Direct3D 12, new in Windows 10, brings the power of a console-like API and is faster and more efficient than ever before. Your game can fully utilize modern graphics hardware and feature more objects, richer scenes, and enhanced effects. Direct3D 12 delivers optimized graphics on Windows 10 PCs and Xbox One. If you want to use the familiar graphics pipeline of Direct3D 11, youâ€™ll still benefit from the new rendering and optimization features added to Direct3D 11.3. And, if youâ€™re a tried-and-true desktop Windows API developer with roots in Win32, youâ€™ll still have that option in Windows 10.

The extensive features and deep platform integration of DirectX provide the power and performance needed by the most demanding games.

### XAML

XAML is an easy-to-use declarative UI language with convenient features like animations, storyboards, data binding, scalable vector-based graphics, dynamic resizing, and scene graphs. XAML works great for game UI, menus, sprites, and 2D graphics. To make UI layout easy, XAML is compatible with design and development tools like Expression Blend and Microsoft Visual Studio. XAML is commonly used with C#, but C++ is also a good choice if thatâ€™s your preferred language or if your game has high CPU demands.

| XAML UI and controls   | [Controls, layouts, and text](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt228348) |

 

### HTML 5

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a common UI markup language used for web pages, apps, and rich clients. Windows games can use HTML5 as a full-featured presentation layer with the familiar features of HTML, access to the Universal Windows Platform, and support for modern web features like AppCache, Web Workers, canvas, drag-and-drop, asynchronous programming, and SVG. Behind the scenes, HTML rendering takes advantage of the power of DirectX hardware acceleration, so you can still get the performance benefits of DirectX without writing any extra code. HTML5 is a good choice if you are proficient with web development, porting a web game, or want to use language and graphics layers that can be easier to approach than the other choices. HTML5 is used with JavaScript, but can also call into components created with C# or C++/CX.

### Combining presentation technologies

The Microsoft DirectX Graphics Infrastructure (DXGI) provides interop and compatibility across multiple graphics technologies. For high-performance graphics, you can combine XAML and DirectX, using XAML for menus and other simple UI, and DirectX for rendering complex 2D and 3D scenes. DXGI also provides compatibility between Direct2D, Direct3D, DirectWrite, DirectCompute, and the Microsoft Media Foundation.

### C++

C++/CX is a high-performance, low overhead language that provides the powerful combination of speed, compatibility, and platform access. C++/CX makes it easy to use all of the great gaming features in Windows 10, including DirectX and Xbox Live. You can also reuse existing C++ code and libraries. C++/CX creates fast, native code that doesnâ€™t incur the overhead of garbage collection, so your game can have great performance and low power consumption, which leads to longer battery life. Use C++/CX with DirectX or XAML, or create a game that uses a combination of both.

### C#

C# (pronounced "C sharp") is a modern, innovative language that is simple, powerful, type-safe, and object-oriented. C# enables rapid development while retaining the familiarity and expressiveness of C-style languages. Though easy to use, C# has numerous advanced language features like polymorphism, delegates, lambdas, closures, iterator methods, covariance, and Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) expressions. C# is an excellent choice if you are targeting XAML, want to get a quick start developing your game, or have previous C# experience. C# is used primarily with XAML, so if you want to use DirectX, choose C++ instead, or write part of your game as a C++ component that interacts with DirectX. Or, consider [Win2D](https://github.com/Microsoft/Win2D), an immediate mode Direct2D graphics libary for C# and C++.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language widely used for modern web and rich client applications.

Windows JavaScript apps can access the powerful features of the Universal Windows Platform in an easy, intuitive wayâ€”as methods and properties of object-oriented JavaScript classes. JavaScript is a good choice for your game if youâ€™re coming from a web development environment, are already familiar with JavaScript, or want to use HTML5, CSS, WinJS, or JavaScript libraries. If youâ€™re targeting DirectX or XAML, choose C# or C++/CX instead.

### Use Windows Runtime Components to combine languages

With the Universal Windows Platform, itâ€™s easy to combine components written in different languages. Create Windows Runtime Components in C++, C#, or Visual Basic, and then call into them from JavaScript, C#, C++, or Visual Basic. This is a great way to program portions of your game in the language of your choice. Components also let you consume external libraries that are only available in a particular language, as well as use legacy code youâ€™ve already written.

### Which version of DirectX should your game use?

If you are choosing DirectX for your game, you'll need to decide which version to use: Microsoft Direct3D 12 or Microsoft Direct3D 11.

Direct3D 11.3 is a low level graphics API that uses the familiar Direct3D programming model. Direct3D 11 is still an option for a Universal Windows app, and you'll have access to the new rendering and optimization features added in Direct3D 11.3.

Direct3D 12 is new in Windows 10 and introduces a new pipeline programming model. Direct3D 12 is closer to the hardware, uses less abstraction, and gives your game better control over resource use. Direct3D 12 has better CPU, GPU, and power performance.

If you have an existing engine written in Direct3D 11, and you're not quite ready to make the jump to Direct3D 12, you can use Direct3D 11 on 12 to achieve some performance improvements and begin your transition to Direct3D 12.

## Prototype and design


Now that you've decided the type of game you want to create and the tools and graphics technology you'll use to build it, you're ready to get started with the design and prototype. At its core, your game is a Universal Windows app, so that's where you'll begin.

### Introduction to the Universal Windows Platform (UWP)

Windows 10 introduces the Universal Windows Platform (UWP), which provides a common API platform across Windows 10 devices. UWP evolves and expands the Windows Runtime model and hones it into a cohesive, unified core. Games that target the UWP can call WinRT APIs that are common to all devices. Because the UWP provides a guaranteed core API layer, you can choose to create a single app package that will install across Windows 10 devices. And if you want to, your game can still call APIs (including some classic Windows APIs from Win32 and .NET) that are specific to the devices your game runs on.

The goal of the UWP is to have:

-   One core operating system
-   One application platform
-   One gaming social network
-   One store
-   One ingestion path

The following are excellent guides that discuss the UWP and Universal Windows apps in detail, and are recommended reading to help you understand the platform.

### Process lifetime management

Process lifetime management, or app lifecyle, describes the various activation states that a Universal Windows app can transition through. Your game can be activated, suspended, resumed, or terminated, and can transition through those states in a variety of ways.

### Designing game UX

The genesis of a great game is inspired design.

Games share some common user interface elements and design principles with apps, but games often have a unique look, feel, and design goal for their user experience. Games succeed when thoughtful design is applied to both aspectsâ€”when should your game use tested UX, and when should it diverge and innovate? The presentation technology that you choose for your gameâ€”DirectX, XAML, HTML5, or some combination of the threeâ€”will influence implementation details, but the design principles you apply are largely independent of that choice.

Separately from UX design, gameplay design such as level design, pacing, world design, and other aspects is an art form of its ownâ€”one that's up to you and your team, and not covered in this development guide.

### Color guideline and palette

Following a consistent color guideline in your game improves aesthetics, aids navigation, and is a powerful tool to inform the player of menu and HUD functionality. Consistent coloring of game elements like warnings, damage, XP, and achievements can lead to cleaner UI and reduce the need for explicit labels.

### Typography

The appropriate use of typography enhances many aspects of your game, including UI layout, navigation, readability, atmosphere, brand, and player immersion.

The DirectX Tool Kit, DirectX texture processing library, and DirectXMesh geometry processing library provide texture, mesh, sprite, and other utility functionality and helper classes for DirectX development. These libraries can save a lot of time and effort compared to implementing these features yourself. Though implemented primarily for Direct3D 11, some portions of these libraries also work in Direct3D 12.

## Production


Your studio is now fully engaged and moving into the production cycle, with work distributed throughout your team. You're polishing, refactoring, and extending the prototype to craft it into a full game.

### Notifications and live tiles

A tile is your game's representation on the Start Menu. Tiles and notifications can drive player interest even when they aren't currently playing your game.

### Enable in-app product (IAP) purchases

An IAP (in-app product) is a supplementary item that players can purchase in-game. IAPs can be new add-ons, game levels, items, or anything else that your players might enjoy. Used appropriately, IAPs can provide revenue while improving the game experience. You define and publish your game's IAPs through the Windows Dev Center dashboard, and enable in-app purchases in your game's code.

## Submitting and publishing your game


The following guides and information help make the publishing and submission process as smooth as possible.

### Packaging and uploading

You'll use the new unified Windows Dev Center dashboard to publish and manage your game packages.

### Policies and certification

Don't let certification issues delay your game's release. Here are policies and common certification issues to be aware of.

### Store manifest (StoreManifest.xml)

The store manifest (StoreManifest.xml) is an optional configuration file that can be included in your app package. The store manifest provides additional features that are not part of the AppxManifest.xml file. For example, you can use the store manifest to block installation of your game if a target device doesn't have the specified minimum DirectX feature level, or the specified minimum system memory.

|                       |                                                                          |

## Game lifecycle management


After you've finished development and shipped your game, it's not "game over". You may be done with development on version one, but your game's journey in the marketplace has only just begun. You'll want to monitor usage and error reporting, respond to user feedback, and publish updates to your game.

### Windows Dev Center analytics and promotion

### Visual Studio Application Insights

Visual Studio Application Insights provides performance, telemetry, and usage analytics for your published game. Application Insights helps you detect and solve issues after your game is released, continuously monitor and improve usage, and understand how players are continuing to interact with your game. Application Insights works by adding an SDK into your app, which sends telemetry to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com/).

### Creating and managing content updates

To update your published game, submit a new app package with a higher version number. After the package makes its way through submission and certification, it will automatically be available to customers as an update.
